You are an analyst working in the assessor’s office of Monroe County, Illinois. A town in your county recently took the nearly unprecedented step of moving the entire town from one location to another in order to mitigate its risk from flood in the Mississippi River floodplain. This town, named Valmeyer, determined that due to the repeated losses of life and property from floods, it was time to move to higher ground.
Your job is to manage and maintain a GIS layer of parcel information, which describes property boundaries and locations, and which other staff in the assessor’s office use in property appraisals, for the county. Because the town moved, this parcel information is now out of date and needs to be updated. In addition, you’ll be adding some information to the parcels to help the state department of emergency management in its analysis of the town’s move so it can better handle future disasters.
