You're a public health analyst with a nonprofit in the United States that is interested in the causes and impacts of air quality in California. For now, you're concerned with what causes the buildup of ozone, a chemical beneficial high up in the atmosphere but harmful to human health when in the air we breath. You are also interested in whether air with higher ozone concentrations disproportionately affects certain groups of people. In a real scenario, you would explore these connections across many variables, but for this analysis, you will explore the affects of elevation on ozone buildup and whether there is a connection between ozone buildup and household income.
